### Hi there 👋

I'm Marco Cesarato, a 25 y/o Italian Fullstack Developer and currently working as Software Architect.

I'm a weird guy 👽 who likes making weird things with the technology.

I like to resolve problems, create smart user interfaces and imagine useful interaction, developing rich web experiences & good web and mobile applications.
I care about creating high-quality, in terms of UI/UX 🔭 and performance 🚀, applications.

I know likely all the most popular programming languages 😆, but I'm ready to pick up new one 🌱.

- 👶 Programming since: 2012
- 📚 Interests: I'm always interested in learning
- 😍 Favorite Programming Language: probably it's PHP, because can be well structured and is dynamic at the same time, don't need too much external libaries and its learning cost is very low, with a very large community, saving more valuable time
- 😄 Pronouns: Marko
- 🎮 Hobbies: I like to play to League of Legends and I think to be a decent player, peak elo Master 😃
