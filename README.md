I'm Marco Cesarato, a Italian Fullstack Software Engineer.

I'm a weird guy 👽 who likes making weird things with the technology.

I like to resolve problems, create smart user interfaces and imagine useful interaction, developing rich web experiences & good web and mobile applications.
I care about creating high-quality, in terms of UI/UX 🔭 and performance 🚀, applications.

I know likely all the most popular programming languages 😆, but I'm ready to pick up new one 🌱.

- 👶 Programming since: 2012
- 📚 Interests: I'm always interested in learning
- 😍 Favorite Programming Language: probably are TypeScript and Python, because they can be well structured and is dynamic at the same time, don't need too much external libaries and its learning cost is very low, saving more valuable time
- 🎮 Hobbies: I like to play to League of Legends and I think to be a decent player, peak elo Master 😃
